This is a training project that allows you to work with golang in conjunction with mongoDB

This project used the mgo library to work with NO-SQL mongoDB. You can read [documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/gopkg.in/mgo.v2) to learn how it works. Also it used package [gorilla/mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux) for easier routing.
